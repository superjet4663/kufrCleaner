# Scientific Facts - Qur'an

The Qur’an is not a science textbook — but it contains **signposts (ayāt)** that point to observable phenomena and cosmological realities long before their scientific verification. These **scientific verses**, when **interpreted within proper [[Usul al-Tafsir]]**, show a **non-contradiction between Revelation and Creation** — a unity central to the [[Tawhidic Worldview]].

This portal indexes such examples. Each note addresses:

- The Qur’anic verse
- Alleged scientific contradiction
- Refutation of Orientalist claims
- Tafsir by classical scholars (e.g. [[Ibn Kathir]], [[Al-Razi]], [[Al-Qurtubi]])
- Modern scientific perspective and polemical conclusions

> [!warning]+ Polemical Use
> These verses are often used in debates to **counter the claim** that Islam is anti-scientific. However, this must not devolve into scientism. Our **framework is theological**, not positivist: science confirms the Qur’an, not the other way around.
