# Christians Under Muslim Rule – Legacy of Fairness

Throughout history, critics of Islam often overlook the treatment of non-Muslim communities under Muslim governance — especially that of Christians. Contrary to popular assumptions, many Syriac, Jacobite, and Orthodox Christian sources _themselves_ document not persecution but **rescue, protection, and fair treatment** under early Islamic rulers.

One such voice is [[John bar Penkaye]], a 7th-century Syriac Christian, who, reflecting on the Byzantine and Persian oppression of his time, declares in his chronicle (𝑹īš 𝑴𝒆𝒍𝒍ē – Book XIV) that:

> “God placed victory into the hands of the Arabs (Muslims), removing the tyranny of both Byzantines and Persians.”  
> (Source: _Sebastian Brock, Studies in Syriac Christianity_, 1992, p. 57)

Similarly, the **Jacobite Patriarch Michael the Elder**, writing in the 12th century, echoes this sentiment. In _Chronique de Michel le Syrien_ (Book XI, Ch. 3), he interprets the coming of Muslims — whom he calls the “sons of Ishmael” — as **divine intervention**, sent by God to relieve the Christians from the brutalities of Byzantine rule: confiscation of churches, destruction of monasteries, and ruthless condemnation of those with different creeds. Michael explicitly describes this as **God’s justice** in action.

Even more telling is the documented treaty between **Jabrīl of Qarṭmīn**, an Eastern Orthodox leader, and Caliph **ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb** (رضي الله عنه) in 639 C.E. Jabrīl approached the caliph personally and returned with joy: Christian clergy were **exempted from taxes**, their **monasteries protected**, and **their religious practices respected**.

These reports are not just from religious texts, but are corroborated by multiple scholars and historians across disciplines:

- **Andrew Palmer**, in _Monk and Mason on the Tigris Frontier_, notes that Gabriel of Dara, a Christian metropolitan, **negotiated peaceful terms** during the Islamic conquests, ensuring safety and autonomy for his community (1990, p. 158).
    
- **Robert G. Hoyland**, in _Seeing Islam as Others Saw It_ (1997, p. 123), highlights **practical arrangements** made by Christian monks and Arab generals — clear signs of mutual respect and realpolitik.
    
- **Brock**, in _Studies in Syriac Christianity_ (p. 57, 61), illustrates how **Muʿāwiya’s rule** was remembered as a time of **unmatched justice** and peace. Syriac Christian writers praised his governance as one of tolerance and dignity, where religious plurality was maintained even amidst warfare.
    

One particularly moving account describes the **Monastery of Mar Gabriel**, where monks faced persecution from Byzantine Chalcedonian bishops. When the Arabs arrived, they were received with **kindness and cooperation**. The local Arab ruler responded with **respect and honor** toward the monastery and its leader.

This collective memory was not marginal. It became a part of Christian historical consciousness for centuries — that Muslims, far from being the aggressors they are often portrayed as today, were **seen as liberators**, defenders of rights, and allies in times of chaos.

Even during **military campaigns**, early Muslim leaders upheld religious diversity. Christians — of various sects — retained their worship, social roles, and internal leadership, paying only a tribute in exchange for state protection.

**Conclusion**

Early Islamic rule demonstrated remarkable tolerance, especially toward Christian communities. Far from the “clash of civilizations” narrative modernity imposes, the actual memory preserved by Christian authors themselves shows **coexistence**, **justice**, and **freedom**.

Muslims didn’t just allow Christians to survive — they allowed them to thrive.
