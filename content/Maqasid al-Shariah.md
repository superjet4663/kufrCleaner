# Maqasid al-Shariah (Higher Objectives of Islamic Law)

**Maqasid al-Shariah** (ŸÖŸÇÿßÿµÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ±Ÿäÿπÿ©) refers to the higher purposes, intentions, and ends for which Islamic law was revealed. While [[Fiqh]] focuses on extracting specific rulings from the texts, *maqasid* addresses the **underlying wisdom (hikmah)** and **goals (maqasid)** that ensure justice, mercy, and benefit (maslahah) are served.

This science provides a **normative framework** that balances textual fidelity with social functionality, and it prevents legalism from overriding the ethical core of the [[Sharia]].

## üß† Classical Objectives

The most widely accepted classical framework, developed by [[al-Shatibi]], outlines five core objectives:

- **Preservation of Religion** (·∏•if·∫ì al-dƒ´n)
- **Preservation of Life** (·∏•if·∫ì al-nafs)
- **Preservation of Intellect** (·∏•if·∫ì al- øaql)
- **Preservation of Lineage** (·∏•if·∫ì al-nasl)
- **Preservation of Property** (·∏•if·∫ì al-mƒÅl)

Some jurists added a sixth: **·∏•if·∫ì al- øir·∏ç** (honour/reputation).

## üìò Key Works and Figures

- *Al-Muwafaqat* by [[al-Shatibi]]
- *Al-Maqasid* by [[Al-Juwayni]]
- *Al-Mustasfa* by [[Al-Ghazali]] ‚Äî foundational maqasid-based classification
- Contemporary revival: [[Ibn Ashur]], [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], and the ISLAMIC FIQH ACADEMIES

## üîç Applications

- Used in [[Usul al-Fiqh]] to override literal rulings when harm outweighs benefit
- Supports adaptive fatwa in [[Fiqh]] under changing conditions
- Integral to [[Islamic Political Theory]] and [[Islamic Economics]]
- Provides ethical criteria in fields like [[Bioethics]], [[Environmental Ethics]], and [[Human Rights in Islam]]

## üìò Criticisms and Refutations of [[Maqasid al-Shariah]]

### üî¥ [[Maqasid is a Modern Innovation Separate from Usul al-Fiqh]]

**Refutation:**
- [[Maqasid al-Shariah]] is embedded in the classical usul tradition, particularly in the works of [[Al-Ghazali]] (*al-Mustasfa*), [[Al-Shatibi]] (*al-Muwafaqat*), and others.
- The error arises when modernists **detach maqasid from its usuli foundations**, applying it outside of [[Nusus]].
- Valid maqasid must be derived via **[[Istiqra]]** (inductive reasoning) from revelation ‚Äî not borrowed from [[Secular Ethics]].

### üî¥ [[Maqasid Overrules Clear Texts]]

**Refutation:**
- No maq·π£id can ever contradict a **[[Qati]] text** (*qat'i al-thubut wa al-dalalah*).
- Classical scholars treated maqasid as **clarifying the application** of text ‚Äî not nullifying it.
- Invoking maqasid to override nass is intellectual deviance ‚Äî indistinguishable from [[Legal Positivism]].

> Cf. [[Al-Shatibi]], *al-Muwafaqat*: "Maqasid are valid only when derived from the shariah, not imposed externally."

### üî¥ [[Maqasid Justifies Modern Islamic Reform]]

**Refutation:**
- Maqasid can support [[Fiqh al-Waqi]] (law responsive to context), but it is **not an open door** to liberal activism.
- Reforms must be internally anchored within **[[Daruriyyat]], [[Hajiyyat]], [[Tahsiniyyat]]**, not Western categories.
- ‚ÄúIslamic reform‚Äù through maqasid without [[Fiqh]] is merely **secularism with Islamic vocabulary**.

### üî¥ [[Maqasid Authorizes Laypeople to Reject Ijma]]

**Refutation:**
- Maqasid is a product of **[[Ijtihad]] by [[Mujtahid]] scholars** ‚Äî not for public speculation.
- When non-scholars invoke maqasid to contest [[Ijma]], it leads to **epistemic chaos**.
- Validity of maqasid requires **[[Ta øaddud al-Mujtahidin]]** ‚Äî multiplicity of qualified derivations.

### üî¥ [[Justice, Freedom, and Human Rights Are Islamic Objectives]]

**Refutation:**
- These terms are **heavily loaded** with [[Enlightenment]] and [[Liberalism]] assumptions.
- In Islam, concepts like [[Adl]] (justice) and [[Hurriyah]] (freedom) are defined within **divine ontology**, not humanistic ethics.
- Uncritical absorption of these terms **replaces tawhidic goals with secular philosophy**.

### üî¥ [[Maqasid Evolves to Override Fixed Rulings]]

**Refutation:**
- Evolution of maqasid (*tathawwur*) applies only to **[[Wasa'il]] (means)**, not to **[[Maqasid al-Din]] (core objectives)**.
- Fixed rulings (*muhkamat*) are rooted in [[Divine Wisdom]], not sociological trends.
