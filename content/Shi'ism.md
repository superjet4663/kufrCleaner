# Shi'ism

 
> [!caution] Disclaimer
> This portal is an academic response to Shia doctrines from the standpoint of Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama‘ah (the Sunni orthodox tradition), especially through the lens of Qur'an, Sahih Hadith, and the epistemology of the classical Sunni scholars. It is **not intended for sectarian provocation**, but rather a **methodical deconstruction of Shia theology, history, and hadith claims**, within the tawḥidic framework of Islamic scholarship.
>
> This is not a war of sects. It is a return to **pure Tawḥīd**, the Qur’anic creed of the Sahabah. It is a **call to reject extremism**, distortion, and elevation of humans to divine ranks. The only solution is:  
> **Tazkiyyat al-nafs**, Qur’an-centric theology, and grounded scholarship.


> _"إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا شِيَعًا لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ"_  
> _"Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects—you are not (associated) with them in anything."_  
> — [Qur’an 6:159](https://quran.com/6/159)

## 📜 1. Foundational Critique: Origins of Shia'ism

- **[The Political Roots of Shi’ism: Siffīn, Karbala and the Fabrication of Doctrine]**  
    → Shi'ism as a post-factum rationalization of political grievances into theological deviation.
    
- **[Development of the 12 Imams Concept – Not Present in Early Islam]**  
    → No mutawātir hadith in Sunni corpus validates the doctrine of 12 specific infallible imams.
    
- **[Ghuluw and the Birth of the Rafidah]**  
    → Early excesses and elevation of ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) to divine levels—condemned even by early Imams like Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq.
    
- **[The Safavid Rewriting of Islam: Shi’ism as State Theology]**  
    → How Persia institutionalized Shi’ism, persecuted Ahl al-Sunnah, and spread fabricated narrations.

## 📚 2. Doctrinal Refutations

### 🔺 **Imamate Vs Prophethood**

|**Shia Claim**|**Sunni Refutation**|
|---|---|
|Imamate is the pillar of religion|Qur’an does not mention any "divinely appointed imams" post-Rasulullah ﷺ|
|Imams are infallible (ma‘ṣūm)|Infallibility (ʿiṣmah) is only for the Prophets|
|Imams have knowledge of the unseen (ʿilm al-ghayb)|Contradicts Quran 27:65 – "None in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except Allah"|

### 🕋 **Distortion Of the Qur'an (Tahrif)**

- **[Tahrif According to Shia Books: al-Kulaynī, al-Majlisī, al-Tūsī]**  
    → Dozens of narrations in al-Kāfī and Tafsīr al-Qummī accuse the Sahabah of deleting verses—an act of kufr.
    
- **[Sunni Position: Qur'an is Preserved Mutawātir]**
    
    > "Indeed, We have sent down the Reminder, and We will preserve it" [Qur’an 15:9](https://quran.com/15/9)  
    > → ʿIjma’ of Ahl al-Sunnah: Qur'an was transmitted by **tawatur**—mass recurrent chains, not dependent on single individuals.

### 🕯 **Cursing The Sahabah (سب الصحابة)**

- **[Authentic Sunni View: All Companions Are Upright (‘Adūl)]**
    
    > "And the first forerunners among the Muhājirīn and the Anṣār… Allah is pleased with them." [Qur’an 9:100](https://quran.com/9/100)
    
- **[Shi'a View: Apostasy of Sahabah Except 3]**  
    → Books like "Rijāl al-Kashshi" declare most Sahabah as apostates after the Prophet ﷺ—a dangerous, kufr-leaning accusation.

## 🧕 3. Historical Myths Refuted

- **[‘Umar Broke Fāṭimah’s Rib: A Fabricated Story]**  
    → No isnād, no chain, not in any Sunni source. Not even in early Shia texts until centuries later.
    
- **[Muṣḥaf Fāṭimah: Alternate Revelation?]**  
    → Claim that Fatimah (رضي الله عنها) had a secret Qur'an contradicts Qur’an 6:115 – “No change in the Words of Allah.”
    
- **[Temporary Marriage (Mutʿah): Legalized Prostitution?]**  
    → Mutʿah was abrogated by the Prophet ﷺ at Khaybar. The four madhāhib agree. Only the Rafidah continue it.
    
- **[Claim that Abu Bakr and Umar Usurped Khilāfah]**  
    → Sahabah gave **bayʿah** by consensus; even ʿAlī (رضي الله عنه) gave allegiance and married his daughter to ʿUmar.

## 📖 4. Hadith Science & Fabrication in Shiaism

- **[Al-Kāfī – Most Trusted Shia Book]**  
    → Only 9,000+ narrations, majority of which are **mursal**, weak or contradictory. Even al-Majlisi admits many are fabricated.
    
- **[Shia Hadith Method Lacks Isnād Rigor]**  
    → Unlike Sunni rijāl sciences (e.g., al-Bukhari, al-Nasa'i), Shia methodology accepts solitary, weak, and ghuluw narrations.
    
- **[Al-Ghadīr Hadith: Clarifying 'Mawla']**  
    → "Mawla" means friend/supporter, not political successor—confirmed by context and classical linguists.

## 🕌 5. Theological Deviations

- **[Belief that Imams Are Above the Prophets]**  
    → Major ghuluw: some Shia claim Imams are greater than Nūḥ, Ibrāhīm, and even Rasulullah ﷺ (naʿūdhu billāh).
    
- **[Taqiyyah: Lying as Worship?]**  
    → Shia doctrine permits lying about belief for protection—resulting in theological schizophrenia and trust crisis.
    
- **[Rajʿah (Return of the Imams)]**  
    → No Qur’anic evidence. Belief that ‘Ali and other Imams will return before Qiyāmah resembles Hindu transmigration.
    
- **[Mahdi in the Cave for 1200+ Years?]**  
    → No Qur’anic reference. The 12th Imam is in **ghaybah kubrā** (major occultation)—a belief foreign to early Muslims.

## 🌍 6. Geopolitical Spread of Shi’ism Today

- **[Iran’s Export of Revolutionary Shi’ism]**  
    → Wilayat al-Faqih as a theological mutation of Imamate into a theocratic dictatorship.
    
- **[Hizbullah and Sectarian Militancy]**  
    → Armed Shia militias used to destabilize Sunni communities under the guise of “resistance.”
    
- **[The Use of Ashura for Political Mobilization]**  
    → Grief as performance, blood rituals, and blame of Sunnis—exploited for statecraft.
