# Islamic Epistemology

 
**Islamic epistemology** (naẓariyyah al-maʿrifah al-Islāmiyyah) is the branch of knowledge that addresses the nature, sources, and hierarchy of knowledge in Islam. It is the foundational meta-discipline that underlies all other Islamic sciences (ʿulūm), determining what constitutes **true knowledge (ʿilm)** versus mere speculation (ẓann), and how knowledge relates to **tawḥīd**.

Unlike modern "epistemology" in Western philosophy, which often starts from human doubt or sense perception, Islamic epistemology begins with **certainty (yaqīn)** in revelation and grounds all other sources hierarchically beneath **[[naql]] (transmitted knowledge)**.

### 🧭 Sources of Knowledge in Islam

According to classical and post-classical scholars, the valid sources of knowledge include:

- **[[Qur'an]]** — the supreme source of divine knowledge
- **[[Sunnah]]** — explanatory and operationalisation of revelation
- **[[‘Aql]] (reason)** — valid only when in service of and not contradicting naql
- **[[Fitrah]]** — the primordial disposition toward truth
- **[[Kashf]]** — unveiled knowledge through spiritual purification (accepted cautiously)
- **[[Hiss]] (sensation)** — empirical experience, lower in hierarchy

> “Aql is like the eyesight, but Qur'an is the light. What good is eyesight in darkness?” — al-Ghazālī

### 🏛 Role in Structuring the Islamic Sciences (ʿUlūm)

Islamic epistemology **does not define the content** of the [[Islamic Disciplines]], but **justifies their epistemic authority**. For example:

- [[Fiqh]] depends on the strength of dalil (evidence) → requires understanding ẓannī vs qaṭʿī sources
- [[Usul al-Fiqh]] is an epistemic grammar that mediates between sources and rulings
- [[Tafsir]] and [[Usul al-Tafsir]] are framed by Qur'anic coherence (e.g. [[Qur'an explains Qur'an]])
- [[Kalam]] and [[Aqidah]] rely on the balance between naql and [[‘Aql|rationality]]

Thus, Islamic epistemology underlies the logic of:

- [[Ijma]] (consensus) as collective epistemic certainty
- [[Qiyas]] (analogy) as epistemic extension
- [[Ijtihad]] as bounded epistemic reasoning
- [[Naskh]] (abrogation) as historical epistemic refinement

### ⚠️ Islam Vs "Secular" Epistemology

Islamic epistemology **rejects the bifurcation** of "religious" and "secular" knowledge. This division is a **colonial inheritance** — not an Islamic construct. True knowledge (ʿilm) is:

> “What leads to the maʿrifah of Allah and reinforces ʿubūdiyyah to Him.” — Imam al-Raghib

In contrast, modern epistemologies often sever ontology (what is) from metaphysics (why it matters), fragmenting knowledge from purpose.
