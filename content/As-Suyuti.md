# As-Suyuti

 
> Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti (Arabic: جلال الدين السيوطي, romanized: Jalāl al-Dīn al-Suyūṭī; c. 1445–1505), or al-Suyuti, was an Egyptian Sunni Muslim polymath of Persian descent. Considered the mujtahid and mujaddid of the Islamic 10th century, he was a leading muhaddith (hadith master), mufassir (Qu'ran exegete), faqīh (jurist), usuli (legal theorist), sufi (mystic), theologian, grammarian, linguist, rhetorician, philologist, lexicographer and historian, who authored works in virtually every Islamic science. For this reason, he was honoured one of the most prestigious and rarest titles: Shaykh al-Islām.

> He was described as one of the most prolific writers of the Middle Ages and is recognized today as one of the most prolific authors of all Islamic literature. Al-Suyuti wrote approximately one thousand works. His biographical dictionary Bughyat al-Wuʻāh fī Ṭabaqāt al-Lughawīyīn wa-al-Nuḥāh contains valuable accounts of prominent figures in the early development of Arabic philology. He was also in his time the leading authority of the Shafi'i school of thought (madhhab).

**Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti** (1445–1505 CE / 849–911 AH) was a prolific **Shāfiʿī polymath**, memorizer of hadith, and a major scholar of **tafsīr**, **hadith criticism**, **Arabic linguistics**, and **legal theory**. His full name was **Abu al-Fadl Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr al-Suyuti**.

He is widely cited in Qur'anic exegesis, particularly for his work *[[Ad-Durr al-Manthur (Tafsir)]]*, a compendium-style tafsir that prioritizes narration-based explanations, and is foundational to the methodology of [[tafsir bil-ma'thur]].

Al-Suyuti was a master in [[Usul al-Tafsir]], and applied intertextual reading in many rulings and arguments, such as the derivation of **minimum gestational period** (see [[quran-46-15-pregnancy-duration]]). He also authored over 500 works, many of which are central to the Islamic tradition.

### Major Works

- *[[Ad-Durr al-Manthur (Tafsir)]]* — narration-based exegesis
- *[[Al-Itqan fi Ulum al-Qur'an]]* — encyclopedic manual on [[Ulum al-Qur'an|Qur'anic sciences (ulum al-Qur'an)]]
- *[[Tadrib al-Rawi]]* — manual on [[usul al-hadith]]
- *Al-Ashbah wa al-Nazair* — legal analogies in Shāfiʿī fiqh
- *Tarikh al-Khulafa* — historical chronicle of caliphs
- *Al-Hawi lil-Fatawi* — fatwa compendium

Al-Suyuti belonged to the **post-classical** period and represented a **synthesizing trend** in Sunni thought, merging rational and transmitted knowledge (ʿaql + naql) in a Tawḥīdic epistemology.

> “He who has no share of tafsīr and ḥadīth, has no understanding of the Qur’an.” — attributed to al-Suyuti
