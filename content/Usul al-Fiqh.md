# Usul al-Fiqh (Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence)

**Usul al-Fiqh** (أصول الفقه) is the methodological discipline that governs the interpretation of textual sources and the derivation of legal rulings in Islam. It establishes **how the Qur'an, Sunnah, Ijma, and Qiyas are interpreted, prioritized, and synthesized**. While [[Fiqh]] is the product, *usul* is the process.

It is not a theological discipline, but an **epistemological one**, concerned with the tools, categories, hierarchies, and limitations of ijtihad.

## 📚 Core Components

- **Sources of Law**
  - [[Qur'an]] — textual clarity (nass), ambiguity (mujmal), and generality (ʿām)
  - [[Sunnah]] — grading of hadith, conflict resolution
  - [[Ijma]] — conditions of consensus
  - [[Qiyas]] — analogical reasoning
  - Supplementary tools: [[Istihsan]], [[Istislah]], [[‘Urf]], [[Sad al-Dhara'i]]
- **Linguistic Analysis**
  - Commands (amr) and prohibitions (nahy)
  - General (`ʿām`) vs specific (`khāṣṣ`) texts
  - Literal (`haqiqi`) vs metaphorical (`majāzi`) meaning
  - Rulings derived from implied meanings (`mafhum al-mukhālafah`)
- **Ruling Categories**
  - [[Fard]], [[Wajib]], [[Haram]](and [[Halal]]), [[Makruh]], [[Mubah]]
  - Legal effects: binding vs non-binding, reward vs punishment
- **Ijtihad and Taqlid**
  - Qualifications of the mujtahid
  - Scope and limits of legal reasoning
  - Historical practice of following schools (taqlid)

## 🧠 Relationship to Other Disciplines

- [[Fiqh]] — applies usuli methods to real-world rulings
- [[Hadith]] — used to evaluate the strength and use of textual evidence
- [[Maqasid al-Shariah]] — integrates teleological goals with legal deduction
- [[Qawaid Fiqhiyyah]] — maxims that emerge from usul principles
- [[Aqidah]] — distinguishes between matters of belief and practice

## 🏛 Classical Works

- *Al-Risalah* — by [[Imam al-Shafi'i]], foundational text
- *Al-Mustasfa* — by [[Al-Ghazali]]
- *Al-Bahr al-Muhit* — by [[Zarkashi]]
- *Ihkam al-Ahkam* — by [[Ibn Hazm]]
- *Al-Talwih* — by [[Sadr al-Shariah]]

## 🔥 Refutations and Misconceptions

- [[Usul al-Fiqh Human Construction]] — responding to claims that it is arbitrary or man-made
- [[Global Ijma is Impossible]] — addressing the modernist objection to consensus
- [[Qiyas is Invalid]] — rebuttal to rejections of analogical reasoning
- [[Criticism of Taqlid]] — unpacking debates around following madhahib
- [[Modernist Rejection of Usul al-Fiqh]] — deconstruction of reformist critiques
