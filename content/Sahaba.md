# Companions of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

> **"The best of my nation is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them."** — [[Hadith]] in [[Sahih Bukhari]]

The **[[Sahaba]]** (Arabic: الصحابة) are those blessed individuals who **lived during the lifetime of the [[Prophet Muhammad ﷺ]]**, believed in him, and had the honor of **direct companionship**. Their actions, sacrifices, and narrations form the living chain of transmission between the Prophet ﷺ and the rest of the Ummah.

## 🧱 What is a Sahabi?

> [!question]+ **Definition from [[Usul al-Hadith]]:**
> “A Sahabi is one who met the [[Prophet Muhammad ﷺ]] while believing in him, and died upon Islam.” — accepted by the majority of Hadith scholars including [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]]

- They are **ʿudūl** (possessors of upright moral character) by default.
- They are **primary transmitters of [[Hadith]]**, and often engaged in [[Jihad]], [[Daʿwah]], and legal consultation.
- They shaped the **early [[Ummah]]**, served as **commanders**, **jurists**, **scribes**, and **leaders**.

> [!info]+ RadiAllahu ʿAnhu (رَضِيَ ٱللَّٰهُ عَنْهُ)
> This Arabic honorific phrase means **"May Allah be pleased with him"**, used after the names of the [[Sahaba|Companions of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ]]. For women, it is **رَضِيَ ٱللَّٰهُ عَنْهَا** and for plural: **رَضِيَ ٱللَّٰهُ عَنْهُمْ**.
>
> The symbol **ؓ** (U+0613) is a typographical sign sometimes used in Arabic script to denote this phrase. However, in this wiki, we use the full form (RA) or the transliterated Arabic form for clarity and indexing.
>
> This phrase is not mere etiquette — it reflects the theological position that the Sahaba were morally upright (*ʿudūl*) and divinely honored, especially when paired with verses such as:
>
> > **"Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him…"** — [Quran 9:100](https://quran.com/9/100)
