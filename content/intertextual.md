# Intertextual

 

The term **intertextual** refers to the relationship between texts, where the meaning of one is shaped or clarified by another. In the context of Islamic sciences, it is most powerfully applied to the principle of **[[Qur'an explains Qur'an]] (tafsīr al-Qur'ān bi al-Qur'ān)** — where the Qur’an is understood through its own internal coherence across verses.

Intertextuality in Qur'anic studies is not merely a literary device but a **hermeneutical principle** in [[usul al-tafsir]], in which scholars derive meaning, reconcile ambiguity (mujmal), and resolve apparent contradiction by placing one verse in light of others. The Qur’an itself invites this recursive engagement:

> _“Do they not reflect upon the Qur’an?”_ — [Qur’an 47:24](https://quran.com/47/24)

### Classical Usage

- [[Ibn Kathir]] is known for beginning many of his tafsir sections with verses from other parts of the Qur’an to explain the verse at hand.
- [[As-Suyuti]] in _[[Ad-Durr al-Manthur (Tafsir)]]_ often collates internal Qur’anic parallels before citing hadith or Athar.
- [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib (RA)]] used intertextual logic in the case of pregnancy duration (see [[quran-46-15-pregnancy-duration]]).

### Methodological Role

Within [[usul al-fiqh]], intertextual reading is a **primary method** for:

- Determining scope (`ʿām` vs `khāṣṣ`)
- Resolving contradictions (`naskh`, `takhṣīṣ`)
- Ascertaining context (`asbāb al-nuzūl`)

### Modern Implications

In apologetics and academic Qur’anic studies, failing to account for intertextual relationships often leads to:

- Allegations of scientific error (e.g., pregnancy length, embryology)
- Misrepresentation of rulings (e.g., [[quran-2-282-women-testimony]])
- Atomization of verses, ignoring Qur’an’s own methodology


**Intertextual coherence** is thus not a modern invention — it is embedded in the Qur’an’s design and recovered through prophetic and companion practice.

- [[Qur'an explains Qur'an]]
- [[usul al-tafsir]]
