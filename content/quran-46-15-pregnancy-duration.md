# Pregnancy Duration in Surah Ahqaf 46:15

A common polemic claims that [Qur'an 46:15](https://quran.com/46/15) implies a pregnancy duration of only six months — contradicting biology. The verse states:

> _“His mother carried him with hardship and gave birth to him with hardship, and his gestation and weaning [period] is thirty months.”_

Critics pair this with [Qur'an 2:233](https://quran.com/2/233), which gives the weaning period as two years (24 months), and conclude that 30 − 24 = 6 months for gestation — calling this a **scientific error**.

But this is a misreading. The six-month period was never presented as a universal biological norm. Instead, it is a **legal minimum**, affirmed within Islamic jurisprudence. [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Ali ibn Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه)]] applied this interpretation in a legal case involving a woman from the tribe of Juhaynah who gave birth six months into her marriage. When she was accused of zina, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Ali (رضي الله عنه)]] cited this verse alongside [Qur'an 2:233](https://quran.com/2/233) to establish the pregnancy as valid. The caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan|Uthman ibn Affan (رضي الله عنه)]] accepted the reasoning and halted the punishment.

This case is preserved in the tafsir of [[As-Suyuti]] in _[[Ad-Durr al-Manthur (Tafsir)]]_ and is also affirmed by [[Ibn Kathir]] in his _Tafsir_. It exemplifies the principle of [[Qur'an explains Qur'an]], a method of interpreting the Qur'an via its own internal coherence, a key principle in [[usul al-tafsir]].

Furthermore, this issue illustrates the Qur’an’s use of [[intertextual]] coherence. The notion that Qur'anic verses explain each other is not merely rhetorical — it's hermeneutically binding. Another verse, [Qur'an 22:5](https://quran.com/22/5), clarifies that gestation varies: _“We settle in the wombs whatever We will for a specified term.”_

Modern science also affirms this flexibility. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pretermbirth.htm) and [ACOG](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/preterm-labor-and-birth), **preterm infants** as early as 23–28 weeks (about six months) can survive with neonatal care. The Qur’an’s mention of this duration is thus both medically and jurisprudentially sound — far from being an error, it’s a sign of its precision.

In [[usul al-fiqh]], this verse was historically used not just for moral reflection, but for legal reasoning. It demonstrates how early scholars and companions applied divine text to real-world judgments — a process grounded in legal hermeneutics, not scientific miscalculation.
