# Even if Committed Adultery, Stole Hadith

The path to Paradise is theft and adultery.  
Muhammad bin Bashar told us, Ibn Abi Uday told us, on the authority of Shu’bah, on the authority of Habib bin Abi Thabit, on the authority of Zaid bin Wahb, on the authority of Abu Dharr, may God be pleased with him, who said: The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: Gabriel said to me: Whoever dies from your nation without associating anything with God will enter Paradise or will not enter Hell. He said: Even if he committed adultery and even if he stole. He said: Even if.  
Sahih Al-Bukhari .. Book of the Beginning of Creation .. Chapter on the Mention of Angels

And to respond to it, God willing,

Imam Al-Nawawi said: The saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings of God be upon him): (I said: Even if he steals and commits adultery? He said: Yes, and even if he drinks alcohol)  
is a severe prohibition of alcohol

and the statement is very clear, had the matter not been so serious, the Prophet (peace and blessings of God be upon him) would not have brought them as an example of serious matters.

Al-Nawawi says

: The saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings of God be upon him): (Even if he commits adultery and steals)  
is an argument for the doctrine of the people of the Sunnah that those who commit major sins are not certain to be in Hell, and that if they enter it, they will be taken out of it and their eternal stay in Paradise will be sealed. All of this has been presented in detail

, but we ask what is the proof of the slanderer from the hadith that there is something in the hadith that permits adultery and theft. The  
prohibition of theft is definite, as Allah the Most High says: “And

as for the thief, male or female, cut off their hands. It is the recompense for what they have earned, an exemplary punishment from Allah. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.”  
(Al-Ma’idah: 38)

. Adultery is definite, as Allah the Most High says: “And do not come near

adultery. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way.” (Al-Isra’: 32).

Allah the Most High says in Surat Al-Furqan: “ And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden.” Except in truth, and they do not commit adultery. And whoever does that will meet a penalty. The punishment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein humiliated. Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (68/70)

The meaning is that the one who commits these major sins will not be removed from the religion completely, for he is a disobedient Muslim who will receive the punishment for this disobedience.

The bottom line is that every Muslim who believes in Allah and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will be held accountable on the Day of Resurrection, and his good deeds will be compared to his bad deeds. If the former outweighs the latter, he will enter Paradise, and if the second is more likely, he will enter Hellfire in proportion to those sins.  
The most that can happen is that he will not remain in Hellfire forever because he believes in God.

The hadith is in Bukhari:  
Yahya bin Bakir told us, Al-Layth told us, on the authority of Aqeel, on the authority of Ibn Shihab, on the authority of Abu Bakr bin Abd al-Rahman, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah,  
that the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: The adulterer does not commit adultery while he is a believer, nor does the drinker drink while he is a believer, nor does the thief steal while he is a believer, nor does the plunder while people look up to him while he is a believer.  
And on the authority of Ibn Shihab, on the authority of Saeed bin al-Musayyab and Abu Salamah, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah, on the authority of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, something similar, except for plunder.

And it came in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, commentary on Jami\` al-Tirmidhi.

His saying: (The adulterer does not commit adultery while he is a believer)  
The waw is for the state. Al-Nawawi said: This hadith is one of the hadiths about which scholars differed in meaning. The correct statement made by the scholars is that it means that he does not commit these sins while he has complete faith.  
Then he said,  
with the consensus of the people of truth that the adulterer, the thief, the murderer, and others who commit major sins other than polytheism do not become disbelievers because of that. Rather, they are believers whose faith is deficient. If they repent, their punishment is dropped. If they die persisting in major sins, they are subject to the will of Allah. If Allah wills, He will pardon them and admit them into Paradise first, and if He wills, He will punish them and then admit them into Paradise.  
Sheikh al-Islam Ibn al-Qayyim commented on  
the hadith, “The adulterer does not commit adultery.” Then he said: And in a wording in the two Sahihs, “And he does not plunder an honorable property that people look up to when he plunders it while he is a believer and a Muslim provides, and he does not steal while he steals while he is a believer. So beware, beware!!!

But let me ask the Christian gentleman: Isn’t the matter with you completely the opposite? Didn’t  
the Lord Christ atone for your sins at the alleged crucifixion  
? So let me ask you: What is the punishment for the adulterer in Christianity? ??? What is the punishment for a thief in Christianity? Will he enter the kingdom or not? If he believes in Jesus and the alleged salvation, will he enter the kingdom without being held accountable or not??
