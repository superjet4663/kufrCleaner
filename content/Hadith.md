# Hadith

**Hadith** refers to the recorded sayings, actions, approvals, and characteristics of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. It forms the second most authoritative source of Islam after the [[Qur'an]], and is foundational for the development of [[Fiqh]], [[Aqidah]], [[Tafsir]], and the entire edifice of Islamic knowledge.

## 📚 Core Concepts

- [[Sunnah]] — the lived tradition of the Prophet ﷺ, distinct from but embodied in Hadith
- [[Hadith Qudsi]] — divine speech conveyed through the Prophet, distinct from Qur'an
- [[Isnad]] — the chain of transmission that determines authenticity
- [[Matn]] — the actual content of the hadith
- [[Sahih]], [[Hasan]], [[Da'if]] — classification of Hadith based on reliability
- [[Mutawatir]] vs [[Ahad]] — epistemic weight of transmission routes
- [[Jarh wa Ta'dil]] — science of evaluating narrators

## 🧠 Sciences of Hadith

- [[Usul al-Hadith|Principles of Hadith Criticism (Usul al-Hadith)]]
- [[Tadrib al-Rawi]] — famous manual by [[As-Suyuti]]

- [[Sahih al-Bukhari]]
- [[Sahih Muslim]]
- [[Sunan Abu Dawud]], [[Jami' at-Tirmidhi]], [[Sunan an-Nasa'i]], [[Sunan Ibn Majah]]

## 🕸️ Hadith and Other Disciplines

- In [[Usul al-Fiqh]] — used as dalil with different epistemic weights
- In [[Tafsir]] — especially via [[tafsir bil-ma'thur]]
- In [[Sira]] — forms the raw material for prophetic biography
- In [[Islamic Ethics]] — applied source for akhlaq and adab
- In [[Fiqh]] — post-Qur’anic elaboration of rulings

## ⚠️ Polemical and Orientalist Claims

- [[Hadith Fabrication]] — critiques and responses
- [[Hadith Collection Timeline]] — refutations of "200-year delay"
- [[Sunnah not written like Qur'an]] — addressed in [[Defense of Hadith Compilation]]
- [[Criticism of Bukhari and Muslim]]
- [[Aisha's Hadith Literacy]]
- [[Women Narrators in Hadith]]
