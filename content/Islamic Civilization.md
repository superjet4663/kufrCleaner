# Islamic Civilization: The Religion of Knowledge and Causality

> "Read! In the name of your Lord who created…" — [Qur'an 96:1](https://quran.com/96/1)

> Islam was not just a *civilization* in the historical sense, but a divine epistemology that **refuted randomness** (atheism), **corrected misguidance** (Christian dogma), and **established causality** as the foundation of the natural and rational sciences.
