# Usul al-Hadith (Principles of Hadith Criticism)

**Usul al-Hadith** (Ê¿Ilm Muá¹£á¹­alaá¸¥ al-á¸¤adÄ«th) refers to the systematic discipline within Islamic scholarship that defines the **rules, tools, and terminology** used to evaluate the authenticity and reliability of Hadith. It is the **methodological grammar** that underpins all engagement with the Sunnah â€” from devotional practice to legal derivation.

This science is indispensable for anyone engaging with [[Hadith]], and is distinct from but related to its practical collection and memorization.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts and Definitions

- [[Isnad]] â€” chain of narrators
- [[Matn]] â€” text/content of the Hadith
- [[Sahih]], [[Hasan]], [[Da'if]] â€” grading reliability
- [[Mutawatir]] vs [[Ahad]] â€” epistemic transmission volume
- [[Marfu']], [[Mawquf]], [[Maqtu']] â€” levels of attribution
- [[Mursal]], [[Mudallas]], [[Munqati']] â€” discontinuity in isnad

## ðŸ“˜ Foundational Works

- *[[Tadrib al-Rawi]]* â€” manual by [[As-Suyuti]]
- *Muqaddimah Ibn al-Salah* â€” foundational methodological work
- *Al-Nukat* by [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]]
- *Sharh Nukhbat al-Fikr* â€” commentary on hadith classification
- *Al-Muqaddimah* by [[Ibn Khaldun]] â€” includes epistemology of hadith transmission

## ðŸ§© Application in Other Sciences

- In [[Fiqh]]: Determines if a hadith can form the basis of a ruling
- In [[Tafsir]]: Validates narrations explaining verses (esp. [[tafsir bil-ma'thur]])
- In [[Sira]]: Differentiates between history and authenticated prophetic action
- In [[Aqidah]]: Ensures creedal points are based on reliable narrations
- In [[Maqasid al-Shariah]]: Ensures purpose-based law rests on valid reports

## ðŸ”¥ Refutations and Modern Misconceptions

- [[Hadith Fabrication]] â€” critiques and responses
- [[Hadith Collection Timeline]] â€” refutations of the "200-year delay"
- [[Sunnah not written like Qur'an]] â€” addressed in [[Defense of Hadith Compilation]]
- [[Criticism of Bukhari and Muslim]] â€” attacks on authenticity refuted
- [[Aisha's Hadith Literacy]] â€” scholarly precision and transmission
- [[Women Narrators in Hadith]] â€” historical female transmitters and their role
- [[Quranists and Rejection of Hadith]] â€” epistemological and historical refutations
