# Ijtihad (Independent Legal Reasoning)

**Ijtihad** (اجتهاد) is the process by which a qualified jurist (mujtahid) exerts maximum intellectual effort to derive legal rulings from the primary sources of Islam: the [[Qur'an]], [[Sunnah]], [[Ijma]], and [[Qiyas]]. It is the foundational legal mechanism that transforms divine revelation into operative law in varying contexts.

Far from subjective opinion, ijtihad is governed by rigorous criteria within [[Usul al-Fiqh]], and is **bounded by epistemic humility, textual authority, and scholarly qualification**.

## 📚 Pre-conditions of Ijtihad

A scholar must:

- Possess mastery of [[Arabic]]
- Be grounded in [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]] sciences
- Know the entire corpus of [[Fiqh]] principles and maxims
- Understand the classifications of [[Qati]] and [[Dhanni]] texts
- Apply [[Maqasid al-Shariah]] correctly and not ideologically
- Understand the customs (`urf`), priorities, and realities of their society

Only such a scholar is eligible to perform ijtihad. Others must adhere to [[Taqlid]] or specialized consultation.

## 🧠 Modes of Ijtihad

- **[[Qiyas]]** — analogical reasoning
- **[[Istislah]]** — public interest
- **[[Istihsan]]** — juristic preference for equity
- **[[Darurah]]** — necessity as principle
- **[[Sadd al-Dhara'i]]** — blocking harmful means

Each mode is constrained by usuli parameters and epistemic weight of evidences.

## 🏛 Classical and Modern Discourse

- Classical debate: continuity of ijtihad vs "closure of the gate"
- Modern revival: **calls to revive ijtihad** are often detached from its actual prerequisites
- True renewal must be grounded in **discipline, not ideology**

## 🔥 Refutations and Misconceptions

- [[Ijtihad is Subjective Interpretation]] — rebuttal to secular hermeneutics
- [[Anyone Can Do Ijtihad Today]] — critique of lay reinterpretation
- [[Ijtihad Replaces Sharia with Reform]] — debunking liberal misuse
- [[Gate of Ijtihad was Closed Forever]] — refuting historical inaccuracy
- [[Ijtihad is Just Copying Western Legal Tools]] — decolonial rebuttal
