# Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence)

**Fiqh** (فقه) refers to the science of deriving detailed legal rulings from the sources of Islam: the [[Qur'an]], the [[Sunnah]], [[Ijma]], and [[Qiyas]]. It is the **human articulation of divine guidance** across all domains of law — personal, civil, criminal, economic, and political.

Unlike [[Sharia]], which represents the **infallible will of Allah**, fiqh is a **fallible human effort (ijtihad)**. It is shaped by context, methodology, and the epistemic strength of textual evidence.

## 📚 Subfields of Fiqh

- [[Ibadat]] — worship: prayer, zakat, fasting, hajj
- [[Mu'amalat]] — transactions: contracts, trade, loans
- [[Uqubat]] — punishments and legal enforcement
- [[Ahwal Shakhsiyyah]] — personal law: marriage, divorce, custody
- [[Jihad]] — law of armed struggle
- [[Hudud]] — fixed punishments
- [[Qada]] — judicial rulings
- [[Fatwa]] — non-binding legal opinions

## 🧠 Disciplinary Context

Fiqh is not self-standing. It operates within a broader system of disciplines:

- [[Usul al-Fiqh]] — its methodological engine
- [[Hadith]] — its raw evidentiary basis
- [[Tafsir]] — source of legal verses ([[Tafsir al-Ahkam]])
- [[Maqasid al-Shariah]] — higher purposes of the law
- [[Qawaid Fiqhiyyah]] — universal maxims that guide juristic reasoning

## 🏛 Classical Schools (Madhahib)

- [[Hanafi]]
- [[Maliki]]
- [[Shafi'i]]
- [[Hanbali]]

These madhhabs developed not as denominations but as **methodological frameworks** grounded in different balances of textual sources, reason, and public interest.
