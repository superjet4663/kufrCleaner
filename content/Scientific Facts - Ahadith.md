# Scientific Facts in Ahadith (Sunnah)

> [!NOTE] Hadith vs Ahadith
> In Arabic, =="hadith" (حديث) is a single report or narrative, while "ahadith" (أحاديث) is the plural form, meaning multiple reports or narratives==. In English, "hadith" is often used both as a singular and a plural. Essentially, "ahadith" refers to the entire collection of reports, while "hadith" refers to a single report within that collection.

This portal collects and organizes verifiable or predictive knowledge conveyed by [[Prophet Muhammad ﷺ]] in the [[Hadith]] corpus, especially where it aligns with modern science, medicine, astronomy, or sociological trends. Each note tackles the **miraculous foresight**, **sahih transmission**, and **polemical implications**.

These are not cherry-picked coincidences — they reflect the divine wisdom (*hikmah*) and **timelessness of the Prophetic knowledge**, preserved in the [[Sunnah]].
